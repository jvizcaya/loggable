# Loggable (Provides functions to record user activities in the application models.)

**Loggable** is a package for Laravel 5.7+ that adds functionalities to record user activities on the tables in the application database, inspired by the [haruncpi/laravel-user-activity](https://github.com/haruncpi/laravel-user-activity) package.

Loggable saves a record in the **logs** table each time a user performs an operation on each model that uses the **Trait** on the **created**, **updated** and **deleted** events.


## InstalLation

```
composer require jvizcaya/loggable
```

We publish the config file if we want to change the table name in the database used by this package, as well as other options.

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Jvizcaya\Loggable\LoggableServiceProvider"
```

Run the migration to export the **logs** table in the database.

```
php artisan migrate
```

## Use mode

Add the trait `Jvizcaya\Loggable\Loggable` to the model of the table we want the user activity logs to be saved.

```php
namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Jvizcaya\Loggable\Loggable;

class Post extends Model
{
    use Loggable;

}
```

That's all, in the previous example a record will be made in the **logs** table every time a user saves, updates or deletes in the **Post** model table.

## Logs delete (console command)  


To delete the activity log data, we can use the available console command **loggable:delete**, this command will delete the logs that are older than the days defined in the loggable.php configuration file (30 days by default).

```
php artisan loggable:delete
```

Optionally, we can pass the value of the days as the command argument.

```
php artisan loggable:delete 5
```

Add the console command **loggable:delete** to [Task scheduling](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/scheduling) for run the command automatically.
